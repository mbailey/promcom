 1 The README is well-structured and clear, but could benefit from:                                                                                         
    • Adding information about minimum requirements (Docker/Podman version, etc.)                                                                           
    • Adding a section about local development vs AWS deployment                                                                                            
    • Including information about the alertmanager which is mentioned in docker-compose but not detailed in the README                                      
    • Adding troubleshooting section based on common issues                                                                                                 

docker-compose.yml Issues and Improvements:                                                                                                                 

 1 Version and Images:                                                                                                                                      
    • The commented-out version tags (#:v2.1.0, #:8.0.0-beta2) are quite old                                                                                
    • Best practice would be to pin specific versions rather than using latest                                                                              
    • Beta versions (grafana 8.0.0-beta2) should not be used in production                                                                                  
 2 Configuration:                                                                                                                                           
    • network_mode: "host" at the top level seems out of place and might conflict with the defined networks                                                 
    • The user ID for Grafana (104) might need explanation or be made configurable                                                                          
    • DNS setting (1.1.1.1) for blackbox_exporter could be made configurable                                                                                
 3 Security:                                                                                                                                                
    • No health checks defined                                                                                                                              
    • No resource limits defined                                                                                                                            
    • Volumes could use more explicit read-only flags where appropriate                                                                                     
 4 Structure:                                                                                                                                               
    • The commented out node_exporter link suggests incomplete configuration                                                                                
    • Network configuration could be simplified (some services might not need both networks)

 1 Update all images to current stable versions                                                                                                             
 2 Add healthchecks                                                                                                                                         
 3 Add resource limits                                                                                                                                      
 4 Review network configuration                                                                                                                             
 5 Add environment variable configuration for customizable values                                                                                           
 6 Consider adding docker-compose.override.yml for local development settings
