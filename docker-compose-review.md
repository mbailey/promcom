# Docker Compose File Review

## Version
```yaml
version: '3.8'
```
This specifies the Docker Compose file format version. 3.8 is a stable version that supports all features needed in this configuration. While 3.9 exists, there's no compelling reason to upgrade unless specific newer features are required.

## Volumes
```yaml
volumes:
    prometheus_data: {}
    grafana_data: {}
```
These define named volumes for persistent data storage. This is important because:
- prometheus_data stores your metrics history
- grafana_data stores your dashboards, users, and settings
The empty brackets {} mean using default options, which is fine here.

## Networks
```yaml
networks:
  front-tier:
  back-tier:
```
Creates two custom networks for service segregation:

- front-tier: For services that need external access
  - Currently used by: Grafana, nginx
  - This allows these services to handle external web traffic while maintaining isolation

- back-tier: For internal service communication
  - Used by: All services (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, Blackbox, nginx)
  - Enables secure internal communication between services
  - Prevents direct external access to monitoring components

Current benefits:
1. Grafana and nginx can serve web traffic while keeping monitoring services private
2. Services in back-tier can communicate without being exposed to the internet
3. Services can be selectively added to either network based on their needs
4. Provides a foundation for adding more services with proper isolation

This network segregation is a security best practice, though currently underutilized as most services are in both networks.

## Services

### Prometheus
```yaml
  prometheus:
    image: docker.io/prom/prometheus
```
Uses the official Prometheus image. Good practice to specify docker.io explicitly.

Volume configuration:
```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus/:/etc/prometheus/
      - prometheus_data:/prometheus
```
Mounts:
- Local config directory to container
- Named volume for data persistence
This is correctly configured.

Command configuration:
```yaml
    command:
      - '--config.file=/etc/prometheus/config.yml'
      - '--storage.tsdb.path=/prometheus'
      - '--web.console.libraries=/usr/share/prometheus/console_libraries'
      - '--web.console.templates=/usr/share/prometheus/consoles'
      - '--web.enable-lifecycle'
```
Standard Prometheus configuration flags. The --web.enable-lifecycle is particularly useful for runtime configuration reloading.

Links (Note: Deprecated):
```yaml
    links:
      - alertmanager:alertmanager
      - blackbox_exporter
```
'links' is legacy and deprecated. Consider removing this and rely on network aliases instead.

### Grafana
```yaml
  grafana:
    image: docker.io/grafana/grafana
```
Historical note on Grafana users:
- Pre-6.5.0 (2019): Grafana ran as root (user ID 0) by default
- A common fix was to set user: "104" (internal grafana user)
- Post-6.5.0: Grafana runs as non-root by default (user ID 472)
- Current best practice: Let Grafana use its default non-root user

## General Recommendations

1. Consider adding healthchecks for each service
2. Consider adding resource limits
3. You might want to add container_name for easier identification
4. Consider adding labels for better organization
5. You might want to add logging configuration

## Security Notes

1. Services are properly segregated into front-tier and back-tier networks
2. Volumes are properly configured for persistence
3. Consider reviewing exposed ports and limiting access where possible

## Maintenance Notes

1. The 'links' directive in Prometheus service should be removed as it's deprecated
2. Version 3.8 is appropriate for current needs
3. Grafana now handles non-root user configuration automatically
