# Docker Compose File Review

## Version
```yaml
version: '3.8'
```
This specifies the Docker Compose file format version. 3.8 is a stable version that supports all features needed in this configuration. While 3.9 exists, there's no compelling reason to upgrade unless specific newer features are required.

## Volumes
```yaml
volumes:
    prometheus_data: {}
    grafana_data: {}
```
These define named volumes for persistent data storage. This is important because:
- prometheus_data stores your metrics history
- grafana_data stores your dashboards, users, and settings
The empty brackets {} mean using default options, which is fine here.

## Networks
```yaml
networks:
  front-tier:
  back-tier:
```
Creates two custom networks:
- front-tier: typically for external-facing services
- back-tier: for internal communication between services
This is a good security practice for network segregation.

## Services

### Prometheus
```yaml
  prometheus:
    image: docker.io/prom/prometheus
```
Uses the official Prometheus image. Good practice to specify docker.io explicitly.

Volume configuration:
```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus/:/etc/prometheus/
      - prometheus_data:/prometheus
```
Mounts:
- Local config directory to container
- Named volume for data persistence
This is correctly configured.

Command configuration:
```yaml
    command:
      - '--config.file=/etc/prometheus/config.yml'
      - '--storage.tsdb.path=/prometheus'
      - '--web.console.libraries=/usr/share/prometheus/console_libraries'
      - '--web.console.templates=/usr/share/prometheus/consoles'
      - '--web.enable-lifecycle'
```
Standard Prometheus configuration flags. The --web.enable-lifecycle is particularly useful for runtime configuration reloading.

Links (Note: Deprecated):
```yaml
    links:
      - alertmanager:alertmanager
      - blackbox_exporter
```
'links' is legacy and deprecated. Consider removing this and rely on network aliases instead.

### Grafana
```yaml
  grafana:
    image: docker.io/grafana/grafana
    user: "104"
```
The user ID is specific - make sure this matches your needs. Sometimes this needs adjustment based on permissions.

## General Recommendations

1. Consider adding healthchecks for each service
2. Consider adding resource limits
3. You might want to add container_name for easier identification
4. Consider adding labels for better organization
5. You might want to add logging configuration

## Security Notes

1. Services are properly segregated into front-tier and back-tier networks
2. Volumes are properly configured for persistence
3. Consider reviewing exposed ports and limiting access where possible

## Maintenance Notes

1. The 'links' directive in Prometheus service should be removed as it's deprecated
2. Version 3.8 is appropriate for current needs
3. Review the Grafana user ID (104) to ensure it matches your security requirements
